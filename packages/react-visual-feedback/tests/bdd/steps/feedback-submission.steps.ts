/**
 * Step definitions for feedback submission feature.
 *
 * These steps implement the Gherkin scenarios in feedback-submission.feature.
 * Most steps are reused from feedback-form.steps.ts and feedback-modal.steps.ts.
 *
 * This file only contains new steps specific to the submission workflow.
 */

// All required steps are already defined in:
// - feedback-modal.steps.ts: Given "I am on the example app homepage", "the feedback modal is open"
//                           When "I click the close button"
//                           Then "the feedback modal should not be visible"
// - feedback-form.steps.ts:  When "I enter the description {string}", "I submit the feedback"
//                           Then "the feedback should be submitted successfully", "the submit button should be disabled"

// No additional steps needed - all steps are already implemented.
