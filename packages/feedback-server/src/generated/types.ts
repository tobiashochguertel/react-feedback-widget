/**
 * API Type Exports
 *
 * This file re-exports types from @feedback/api-types workspace package.
 * Use these types in route handlers, services, and tests for type-safe API interactions.
 *
 * @example
 * import type { Feedback, CreateFeedbackRequest, FeedbackListResponse } from "@/generated/types";
 *
 * @deprecated Import directly from "@feedback/api-types" instead of "@/generated/types"
 */

// Re-export everything from the workspace package
export * from "@feedback/api-types";
