# Tasks

## Task Format Guidelines

**Format:**
- Task number + title
- Status: "Done" or "Open"
- Description: Brief explanation of what needs to be done

**What we AVOID:**
- NO phases, timelines, periods, hours, or time estimates
- NO complex metadata or status tracking beyond "Done" or "Open"
- NO unnecessary categorization or grouping
- Keep it simple: number, title, status, description

**Why:**
Simple task tracking works. Complex project management overhead doesn't. We work task by task, marking them done as we complete them.
